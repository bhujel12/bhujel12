- 👋 Hi, I’m Anish Bhujel!

- 👀 I’m interested in developing mobile apps and someday working on web applications too. 
I have an interest in finance and business so I want to incorporate those things into my journey
and make it all the more interesting

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and using Unity and Visual Studio to develop games
-    Also, I'm learning the .NET framework to develop web applications 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects including games and general software for the web.
